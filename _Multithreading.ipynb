    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. A thread is a separate flow of execution that can run concurrently with other threads, allowing for concurrent or parallel execution of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to achieve concurrent execution, enabling programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and efficiently utilize system resources. It is beneficial in situations where there are multiple independent tasks that can run concurrently, such as handling I/O operations, network requests, or performing computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantages of using multithreading in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of tasks, enhancing the responsiveness of a program. It enables programs to continue executing other tasks while waiting for input/output operations or resource availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Efficiency: By utilizing multiple threads, a program can efficiently use system resources and make better use of available processing power. It enables tasks to run in parallel, potentially reducing overall execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enhanced Concurrency: Multithreading enables programs to handle multiple operations concurrently, enhancing concurrency and the ability to handle multiple user requests or events simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called `threading`. It provides a high-level interface and functions for working with threads, allowing you to create, manage, and control threads within your Python programs. The `threading` module simplifies thread creation and synchronization, making it easier to work with threads and build multithreaded applications in Python."

    "The `threading` module in Python is used to handle threads, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks within a program. It provides a high-level interface for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the following functions from the `threading` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `activeCount()`:\n",
    "   The `activeCount()` function returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. It returns an integer representing the count of active threads, including the main thread. It can be useful for monitoring the number of active threads in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_task():\n",
    "       print(\"Hello from thread!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Create and start a thread\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=my_task)\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Get the count of active threads\n",
    "   count = threading.activeCount()\n",
    "   print(\"Active threads:\", count)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new thread is created and started using the `Thread` class from the `threading` module. After starting the thread, the `activeCount()` function is called to get the count of active threads, which is then printed. In this case, the count will be 2 (main thread + created thread).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `currentThread()`:\n",
    "   The `currentThread()` function returns the current Thread object corresponding to the calling thread. It provides a way to obtain the current thread instance within a thread function. This can be useful for identifying the currently executing thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_task():\n",
    "       current_thread = threading.currentThread()\n",
    "       print(\"Current thread name:\", current_thread.name)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Create and start a thread\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=my_task)\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `my_task()` function is executed within a separate thread. Inside the function, the `currentThread()` function is called to obtain the current thread object, and the name of the current thread is printed. This allows you to identify the currently executing thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `enumerate()`:\n",
    "   The `enumerate()` function returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive. It returns a list containing all active threads, including the main thread. It can be useful for obtaining a list of active threads and performing operations on each thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_task():\n",
    "       print(\"Hello from thread!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Create and start a thread\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=my_task)\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Enumerate all active threads\n",
    "   threads = threading.enumerate()\n",
    "   for t in threads:\n",
    "       print(\"Thread name:\", t.name)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new thread is created and started. After that, the `enumerate()` function is called to get a list of all active threads. The list is then iterated over, and the name of each thread is printed.\n",

    "Here's an explanation of the following functions related to thread management in Python's `threading` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `run()`:\n",
    "   The `run()` method is the entry point for the thread's activity. It is called when the `start()` method of a `Thread` object is invoked. By default, the `run()` method in the `Thread` class does nothing. To define the behavior of the thread, you can subclass `Thread` and override the `run()` method with your custom implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "       def run(self):\n",
    "           print(\"Thread is executing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Create and start a custom thread\n",
    "   thread = MyThread()\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a custom thread class `MyThread` is created by subclassing `Thread`. The `run()` method is overridden to print a message. When the thread is started with `start()`, the `run()` method of the custom thread is automatically called, and \"Thread is executing\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `start()`:\n",
    "   The `start()` method starts the execution of the thread by invoking the `run()` method in a separate thread of control. It initializes the thread and calls the `run()` method asynchronously. The `start()` method should only be called once per thread object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_task():\n",
    "       print(\"Thread is executing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Create and start a thread\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=my_task)\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new thread is created using the `Thread` class, with `my_task()` as the target function. The `start()` method is called to start the execution of the thread. This creates a new thread of control that invokes the `my_task()` function in parallel with the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `join()`:\n",
    "   The `join()` method blocks the calling thread until the thread on which it is called terminates. It ensures that the calling thread waits for the completion of the specified thread before proceeding further. This is useful when you want to wait for a thread to finish its execution before continuing with subsequent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_task():\n",
    "       print(\"Thread is executing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Create and start a thread\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=my_task)\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Wait for the thread to finish\n",
    "   thread.join()\n",
    "   print(\"Thread has finished execution\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new thread is created using the `Thread` class, and `my_task()` is set as the target function. After starting the thread, the `join()` method is called on the thread object. This blocks the main thread and waits until the thread completes its execution. Once the thread finishes, \"Thread has finished execution\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `isAlive()`:\n",
    "   The `isAlive()` method checks whether a thread is alive or not. It returns `True` if the thread is currently executing or is still alive, and `False` otherwise. This method is useful when you want to determine the state of a thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "   import time\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_task():\n",
    "       time.sleep(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Create and start a thread\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=my_task)\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Check if the thread is alive\n",
    "   if thread.isAlive():\n",
    "       print(\"Thread is still running\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Thread has finished\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, a new thread is created using the `Thread` class, and `my_task()` is set as the target function. After starting the thread, the `isAlive()` method is used to check if the thread is still running. Since we introduce a 2-second delay in the `my_task()` function using `time.sleep(2)`, the output will be \"Thread is still running\" until the thread completes its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions (`run()`, `start()`, `join()`, and `isAlive()`) are essential for managing the execution and synchronization of threads in Python. They allow you to define the behavior of a thread, start and control the execution of threads, wait for thread completion, and check the state of a thread."
